<p><strong>Chapter 10: Emotional Awareness Activities for Older Children</strong></p>

<p>As children grow and mature, their emotional awareness and regulation become increasingly important for their social, emotional, and academic development. Older children, typically between the ages of 8 and 12, are in a critical phase of development where they are learning to navigate complex social relationships, manage their emotions, and develop a sense of self. Emotional awareness activities can play a significant role in supporting this development, helping older children to better understand and manage their emotions, empathize with others, and build strong relationships.</p>
